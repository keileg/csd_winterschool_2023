    "# Simulation of poromechanical processes in a fractured porous medium\n",
    "This noteboook aims to give an overview of the problem of poromechanical deformation of\n",
    "a fractured porous media, and how this can be simulated in 2d. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that we assume the reader has already gone through the notebook on\n",
    "mixed-dimensional flow problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Governing equations\n",
    "PorePy simulates mechanical deformation of a porous media, denoted $\\Omega_M$ as a coupled system with \n",
    "conservation of momentuum and mass. Using the displacement $u$ and the fluid pressure $p$\n",
    "as primary variables, the conservation equations are \n",
    "$$\\nabla \\cdot \\sigma = \\nabla\\cdot (\\mathbb{C} \\epsilon - I\\alpha p_m) = f_s $$\n",
    "for momentum and \n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\rho\\phi}{\\partial t} - \\nabla\\cdot (\\rho K \\nabla p_m) = f_f$$\n",
    "for mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\sigma$ is the stress, $\\mathbf{C}$ is the stiffness matrix, $\\epsilon$ the\n",
    "symmetrized displacement gradient, $I$ an identity tensor and $f_s$ body forces.\n",
    "Moreover, $\\rho$ represents fluid density, $\\phi$ porosity, $K$ permeability,  \n",
    "$f_f$ fluid sources and sinks, and the subscript $m$ on the pressure marks that this is the pressure in the matrix.\n",
    "In addition come initial and boundary conditions; we will for simplicity disregard these.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we introduce a fracture $\\Omega_F$ and let $\\Gamma$ represent the interface between $\\Omega_M$ and $\\Omega_F$.\n",
    "The model for fluid flow in the fracture is the same as in the notebook for mixed\n",
    "dimensional flow, and we will not review it here.\n",
    "For the mechanical behavior, we introduce the contact stress $T$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T = n\\cdot(\\mathbb{C}\\epsilon - I p_m) - p_f I \\cdot n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $n$ is a vector normal to the fracture.\n",
    "The model for the deformation of the fracture consists of three components. \n",
    "First, balance of forces across the fractures, which reads\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T^+ + T^- = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where superscripts $+$ and $-$ denote the two sides of the fracture.\n",
    "Second, in the normal direction of the fracture, there are two possible configurations:\n",
    "Either, the fracture is open (the walls are not in contact) and the contact force is zero,\n",
    "or the walls are in contact and the force is potentially non-zero.\n",
    "Mathematically this can be expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ [u]_n\\geq 0 \\qquad [u]_n T_n = 0 \\qquad T_n \\leq 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where subscript $n$ represents the normal component of a vector and $[u]$ is the displacement\n",
    "jump across the fracture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, motion in the tangential direction of the fracture is restricted by a Coulomb-type friction law:\n",
    "There will be no motion as long as the tangential forces are insufficient to overcome the\n",
    "frictional resistance, but if this is overcome, the displacement jump in the tangential\n",
    "direction will change (note: we do not resolve the actual movement of the walls, but \n",
    "only search for the next static condition). This is expressed in terms of the following\n",
    "equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    ||T_\\tau||&\\leq - F T_n \\\\\n",
    "    ||T_\\tau||&< - F T_n \\Rightarrow [u]_\\tau =0\\\\\n",
    "    ||T_\\tau||&= - F T_n \\Rightarrow \\exists \\,\\zeta \\in \\mathbb{R^+}: [u]_\\tau = \\zeta T_\\tau.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $F$ represents the coefficient of friction and subscript $\\tau$ denotes the\n",
    "tangential component of a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that this is a problem of considerabe difficulty: Not only is the problem non-linear,\n",
    "which equations we have to solve actually depends on the solution. This is an example of\n",
    "a class of problems known as variational inequalities. Fortunately, PorePy has implemented\n",
    "methods to deal with these problems, and it is to implementational aspects we now turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "To construct a PorePy simulation model for poromechanical fracture deformation, we proceed\n",
    "in much the same way as we did for the flow problem, except that the template model\n",
    "that we will expand on is `pp.poromechanics.Poromechanics`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to define a geometry class that sets a fracture network. For this, we\n",
    "simply copy the relevant function from the flow notebook."
